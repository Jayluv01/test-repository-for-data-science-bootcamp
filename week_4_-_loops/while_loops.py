# A while loop runs based on a condition. The loop does not end until a set condition resolves to false.

# while condition:
    # runs code indented in the while block
#    print("Statement")

# print("Statement")

# Example: 
count = 1  

while count<= 20:
    print(count)

    count = count + 1

print("I'm done with the loop")
