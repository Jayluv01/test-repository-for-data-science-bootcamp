# A list is a data type. Just like strings, booleans, integers, and floats.
# A llst is a container that holds multiple values ina sinlge variable. Think of it like:
# A playlist with multiple songs
# List items are seperated by commas.

# Test scores
scores = [56, 80, 90, 40, 79, 50]

# Shopping list
shopping = ["rice", "milk", "bread", "eggs"]

# A list can have mixed data types, although it isn't recommended
mixed = ["John", 25, False, 3.14, ["Chris"]]

# It's okay to define an empty list. Items can always be added later.
empty_list = []

# Lists are mutable because they can change form by modifying their 

# Common indexing errors:
# List index out of range. e.g:
# print(mixed[9])
